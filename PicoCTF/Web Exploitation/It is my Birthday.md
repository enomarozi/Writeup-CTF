<h1>It is my Birthday</h1>
<p>I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website. http://mercury.picoctf.net:55343/</p>
<p>Hint :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Look at the category of this problem.</li>
  <li>How may a PHP site check the rules in the description?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>Hash Collision, File Collision terdapat pada link https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/, Ganti ekstensi file (hello dan erase) ke PDF, dan Eksekusi ke URL</p>

```python3
import hashlib

ship_image = open('hello.pdf','rb').read()
plane_image = open('erase.pdf','rb').read()

hash_1 = hashlib.md5(ship_image).hexdigest()
hash_2 = hashlib.md5(plane_image).hexdigest()
if hash_1 == hash_2:
    print("Hash ship  :",hash_1)
    print("Hash plane :",hash_2)
    print("MD5 Hash Collision!!")
```
<p>Output Program</p>

```
Hash ship  : cdc47d670159eef60916ca03a9d4a007
Hash plane : cdc47d670159eef60916ca03a9d4a007
MD5 Hash Collision!!
